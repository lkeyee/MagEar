# MagEar
There are two recovered audios eavesdropped by MagEar.
* Airpods_50cm_processed.wav: The receiver coil is placed 50cm away from Airpods.
* Iphone_50cm_processed.wav: The receiver coil is placed 50cm away from Iphone.

Two original audios played by Airpods/Iphone.
* Airpods_original.wav.
* Iphone_original.wav.

To evaluate the quality of our recovered audios, we resample the original audio at different sampling rates. In the folder “downsampling audios/”
* Airpods_original_24k.wav: The original audio played by Airpods, which has a sampling rate of 24kHz.
* Airpods_original_16k.wav: Downsampling the original audio to 16kHz sampling rate in Python.
* Airpods_original_8k.wav: Downsampling the original audio to 8kHz sampling ratein Python.
* Airpods_original_4k.wav: Downsampling the original audio to 4kHz sampling rate in Python.
* Airpods_original_2k.wav: Downsampling the original audio to 2kHz sampling rate in Python.
